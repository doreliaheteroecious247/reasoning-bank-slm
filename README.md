## Project Overview

**ReasoningBank SLM** is an experiment that applies Google Research's `ReasoningBank` framework to small language models (â‰¤3B parameters). This project tests whether the memory-based self-improvement techniques from the original ReasoningBank paper also benefit much smaller, less capable models.

### What is ReasoningBank?

ReasoningBank is a novel memory framework introduced by Google AI (September 2025) that enables LLM agents to learn continuously from their interaction history. Instead of discarding insights after each task, ReasoningBank:

1. **Distills reasoning strategies** from both successful and failed experiences
2. **Stores them as reusable memory items** with semantic embeddings  
3. **Retrieves relevant memories** during new tasks to inform decision-making
4. **Integrates new learnings back** into the memory bank, enabling self-evolution

The framework combines memory awareness with test-time scaling (MaTTS), establishing a symbiotic relationship where better memory guides more effective scaling, and abundant experiences create higher-quality memory.

### Why Small Language Models?

While ReasoningBank was demonstrated on larger models, this experiment investigates whether similar gains apply to small models (1-4B parameters). Small models have advantages but often struggle with:
- Insufficient internal knowledge retention
- Limited reasoning capabilities  
- Difficulty transferring learning across tasks

If ReasoningBank can improve small model performance, it could:
- Enable more capable reasoning with minimal compute
- Create more accessible AI for resource-constrained environments
- Demonstrate that strategic memory retrieval is more valuable than model scale alone

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

- **`src/memory.py`**: JSON-based memory storage for reasoning strategies
- **`src/retrieval/retriever.py`**: Semantic search with answer leak protection
- **`src/extraction/extractor.py`**: LLM-powered strategy extraction from trajectories  
- **`src/llm_client.py`**: OpenAI-compatible client for llama-server
- **`src/judge/evaluator.py`**: Dataset-aware math solution evaluation
- **`src/run_phase1.py`**: Experiment orchestration comparing baseline vs. memory-augmented performance

### Memory Schema

Each memory item contains:
```json
{
  "title": "Strategy name",
  "description": "One-sentence summary", 
  "content": "Detailed transferable strategy",
  "source_problem_id": "Origin problem",
  "success": true,
  "created_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, ...]
}
```

### Answer Leak Protection

Critical for fair evaluation, the retrieval system filters memories containing:
- Numeric values matching the test item's expected answer
- High similarity (>90%) to the full question text

## Experiments

### Phase 1: Does Retrieval Help?

Currently implemented and measures whether memory retrieval improves a 4B model's `competition_math` math performance.

**Methodology:**
1. Build memory bank from training set trajectories 
2. Test baseline accuracy without memory
3. Test memory-augmented accuracy with retrieval
4. Compare with statistical significance testing

**Results materialize as:**
- `results/phase1_results.json`: Complete trial records
- `results/phase1_summary.json`: Statistical analysis
- `results/phase1_accuracy.png`: Performance visualization

### Planned Phases

**Phase 2: Can It Self-Improve?**
- Harvest successful reasoning traces
- Fine-tune model on consolidated strategies
- Test on previously failed problems

**Phase 3: Does It Compound?**  
- Run multiple improvement cycles
- Measure compounding effects
- Analyze memory quality evolution
